## ECDSA Node Transactions

This project is an example of using a client and server to facilitate transfers between different addresses on a blockchain network. Although, Since there is just a single server on the back-end handling transfers, this is clearly very centralized. But, this project is focused on replicating the secure ecdsa public key cryptography for sending and verifying transactions.
